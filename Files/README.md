Save workspace_utils.py into your notebook's directory.

Then in your notebook run:

import workspace_utils.py

and use it to wrap your long running code, as shown below:

from workspace_utils import active_session
 
with active_session():
    # do long-running work here
You can also get workspace_utils.py directly from a Jupyter terminal like so:

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/udacity/workspaces-student-support/master/jupyter/workspace_utils.py
